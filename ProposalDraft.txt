11/7 meeting with professor:

1. Use 2014 "Birth Data Files" - for successful births (~5 GB data)
2. Use 2014 "Period Linked Birth-Infant Death Data Files" (~5 GB data)

Metrics:
------------
1. Which features are most pre-dominant in successful births 
2. Which features are most pre-dominant in unsuccessful births

Prediction:
-----------
1. Based on features values can we predict the survival of the infant in %.


Utilize at least 3 of the concepts below, with at least one from data pipelines:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Pipelines (Frameworks): Spark
Analytics: Similarity Search, Link Analysis, Linear Modeling, Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction,  Large-Scale Machine Learning, Distributed TensorFlow (need to figure out which ones will be most applicable besides machine learning)
