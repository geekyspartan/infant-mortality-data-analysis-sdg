	1. Apgar score by race across datasets 
	2. abnormal conditions of newborn by race/maernal health
	3. What is the leading cause of death in US ? 
	4. Correlation amongst the features


Prediction:
-----------
	a. Maternal Morbidity  			[Insights: assess risk of mother's life]
	b. Weight at Delivery  			[Insights: take preventive measures, if possible] 
	c. Possible cause of death  	[Insights: take preventive measures, if possible]
	d. can we predict successful birth or not based on existing conditions of health for the mother and smoking etc habits, gestation parameters?
	e. predict apgar score based on features like mother's health and habits and race




Other notes:
